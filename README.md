This project is about analysing how materials made of copper, kapton and adhesive as layers for solar panel circuits degrade by heat as a fuction of time and temprature. Hence, examined by using optical profilometer instrument.

After taking samples of the layers under the instrument, a surface is generated from the roughness data and the text file is changed into a 3D model using the matlibplot package.


- add more functions using numpy and panda.
