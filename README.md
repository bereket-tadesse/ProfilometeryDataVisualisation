I am developing this program as part of the SDLE center for research center at Case Western Reserve university.

The project is about analysing how materials made of copper, kapton and adhesive as layers for solar panel circuits degrade by heat as a fuction of time and temprature. Hence, examined by using optical profilometer instrument.

I have been taking samples of the layers under the instrument and gnerating a plane of surface roughness using python programing. This python package I am working on automates the surface detected and change the text file into a 3D model using the matlibplot package.

The package is still under developement in collaboration with other researchers as well.

Next plan for this package is to utilize numpy and panda to analyse the vertex alignments as matrix and arrays.
