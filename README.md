# Solar Panel Kapton Material Degradation Analysis
This repo contains code for analyzing the degradation of materials used in solar panel circuits over time and temperature. The analysis is performed using data obtained from an optical profilometer instrument. The primary materials: copper, kapton, and adhesive.

The data used in this analysis is collected from the optical profilometer instrument. The instrument measures the roughness of the materials' surfaces as a function of time and temperature. The roughness data is then used to generate a 3D model of the surfaces using the Matplotlib package.

## Code Description
The code in this repository is written in R and utilizes the Tidyverse library for data manipulation and visualization. 
There are four main visualizations generated by the code:

1. Time Vs Roughness of Kapton
This plot displays the relationship between time and the roughness of Kapton material at different magnifications. 

2. Time Vs Light Intensity
This plot illustrates the relationship between time and light intensity at different magnifications. The data points are color-coded to differentiate between linear regression models. The x-axis represents time in minutes, and the y-axis represents light intensity in percentages.

3. Time Vs Z-axis
This plot shows the relationship between time and the Z-axis measurements at different magnifications. The x-axis represents time in minutes, while the y-axis represents Z-axis values in millimeters. Data points are color-coded based on magnification.

4. Time Vs Roughness (microns)
This plot visualizes the relationship between time and roughness in microns at different magnifications. The x-axis represents time in minutes, and the y-axis represents roughness in microns. Data points are color-coded by magnification.

## How to Use the Code
To use this code, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have R installed on your system.
- Install the required libraries, including Tidyverse and ineq.
- Load your data by modifying the read.csv() function with the appropriate file path and headers.
- Run each of the code sections for the four visualizations.
